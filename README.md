# Port Scanner
## Function 
This program is a simple port scanner that allows you to identify if ports on your local network are open or closed. This tool can be used to monitor whether traffic can flow through your ports, troubleshoot with the information it provides, and better understand how your internet works and how ports function.

## Tech Used
- PyCharm IDE, written in Python

## Optimizations
As I update this script, I will add optimizations I have made to it here. (Current Version: 1.0.0)

## Stipulations
- This program is to be used only on your own network, or a network on which one has been permitted to port scan. Please do not use it for any other purpose.
- This is a very simple program currently, but I intend to update and expand its capabilities in future updates, as well as upload additional scripts to my repository.
