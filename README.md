# port-scannersimple
# This program is a simple port scanner that allows you to identify if ports on your local network are open or closed. This tool can be utilized to monitor if traffic is able to run through your ports, troubleshoot with the information received from this script, and be more aware of how your internet functions and how ports work.
  # This program is to be used only on your own network, or a network which one has been permitted to port scan. Please do not use it for any other purpose.
    This is a very simple program currently, but I intend to update and expand its capabilities in future updates, as well as upload additional scripts to my repository.
